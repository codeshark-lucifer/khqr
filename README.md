# KHQR API

This API allows users to donate money using KHQR.

## Donate Money using QR Code

To donate money using a QR code, you need to follow these steps:

1.  **Generate a QR Code:** Use a KHQR code generator to create a QR code for the recipient's account.  Many banks and payment providers in Cambodia offer this functionality through their mobile apps or websites.  This QR code will contain the necessary payment information, including the recipient's account number and the amount to be donated (if specified).

2.  **Scan the QR Code:** Use a mobile banking app or a QR code scanner that supports KHQR to scan the recipient's QR code.

3.  **Confirm Payment Details:** The app will display the payment details, including the recipient's name, account number (partially masked for security), and the donation amount (if specified in the QR code).  Review these details carefully to ensure accuracy.

4.  **Enter Donation Amount (if necessary):** If the QR code doesn't specify a donation amount, you will be prompted to enter the amount you wish to donate.

5.  **Authorize Payment:** Follow the instructions in your banking app to authorize the payment. This may involve entering your PIN, using biometric authentication (fingerprint or facial recognition), or confirming the transaction through a one-time password (OTP) sent to your registered mobile number.

6.  **Payment Confirmation:** Once the payment is successfully processed, you will receive a confirmation message within the app.  You may also receive an SMS or email notification.  It's a good practice to take a screenshot of the confirmation for your records.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Security:** Always use official and trusted banking apps or QR code scanners to avoid potential scams or security risks.
*   **Accuracy:** Double-check the payment details before authorizing the transaction to ensure the money is sent to the correct recipient.
*   **Fees:** Some banks or payment providers may charge fees for KHQR transactions. Check with your provider for their fee schedule.
*   **Limits:** There may be daily or per-transaction limits on the amount you can donate using KHQR.  These limits vary depending on your bank and account type.
